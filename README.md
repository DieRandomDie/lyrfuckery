- Adds a kill per hour tracker to left sidebar.

- Adds two checkbox near chat button to clean up chat.

KPH is based on daily kills and server time, the number reflects your KPH for the day.

Chat cleaner will filter chat based on the chatchannel dropdown. Global killer will remove all of the non-toggleable globals.

Cleaner doesn't work with custom chats atm. Uncheck the box to use custom chat.
